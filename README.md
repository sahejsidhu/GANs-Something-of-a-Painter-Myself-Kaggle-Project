In this project, a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is built and trained to generate images in the style of Claude Monet, and the aim is to generate 7,000-10,000 Monet-style images and submit them in a zip file. The dataset contains four directories: monet_tfrec, photo_tfrec, monet_jpg, and photo_jpg.
The Monet directories contain Monet paintings (300 images) and the photo directories contain photos (7028 images), both sized 256x256. The GAN architecture uses convolutional layers for feature extraction and transposed convolutions for image generation in the generator, and convolutional layers to distinguish between real Monet paintings and generated images in the discriminator, with both compiled using binary cross-entropy loss and the Adam optimizer; the GAN is trained over multiple epochs using batches of real and generated images, with the discriminator learning to distinguish between them and the generator learning to produce realistic Monet-style images, logging losses every 100 epochs, resulting in a trained generator capable of generating Monet-style images from random noise.
