In this project, a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is built and trained to generate images in the style of Claude Monet.
The aim is to generate 7,000-10,000 Monet-style images and submit them in a zip file.
The dataset contains four directories: monet_tfrec, photo_tfrec, monet_jpg, and photo_jpg.
The Monet directories contain Monet paintings (300 images) and the photo directories contain photos (7028 images), both sized 256x256.
